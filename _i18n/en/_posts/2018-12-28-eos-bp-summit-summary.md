Last November, eosDAC was invited to [EOS BP Summit & CryptoFinance](https://www.cryptofinance.no/#bpsummit) in Oslo, Norway hosted by @bitspace. 


EOS Block Producers from around the world attended this event to give insight into what is required to be a BP in a 3rd generation blockchain ecosystem.

The talks and panel discussions covered topics such as technical developments since the launch of EOS, community initiatives, security & infrastructure challenges, governance and what we can look forward to seeing in 2019.

During the conference, EOS Authority introduced this brilliant initiative to make EOS the world's first major carbon neutral blockchain. EOS Authority has paid for the standbys who did not pay in time for their offset and ClimateCare for the full 562 tonnes of CO2 offset. Learn about it here: https://eosauthority.com/green/ or join the discussion t.me/eosiozeroco2

The goal was to offset the entire EOS carbon footprint, 562 tonnes of CO2 for 1 year (10th June 2018 to 9th June 2019) by 30 November. Within a week, over 36% of the BPs supported the initiative started and together we achieved the goal by the deadline. EOS is now the world’s first carbon neutral blockchain!

17th’s conference was more focused on the blockchain industry in general, yet representatives from EOS New York, EOS42 and EOS Nation had a panel session to introduce EOS to the audience who were not familiar with the concept of EOS/EOS.io and the role of a block producer and its governance.  

Find the video [here](https://steemit.com/cryptofinance2018/@bitspace/panel-introduction-to-eos-w-kevin-rose-david-packham-and-yves-la-rose-cryptofinance-2018-video)

Topics included: What is EOS? Where to begin if curious about EOS? What is the role of a block producer? Do BPs compete or collaborate? What is the difference between EOS and EOS.io? Governance: How are collective decisions made in the network? What are dApps? How to overcome the challenge of communication between East and West? 2019 projections for investment and business.

Thank you @bitspace and other sponsors for this meaningful event and we hope to see you all in the next event.
