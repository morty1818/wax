# This weeks highlights 

* eosDAC has submitted the Lost Key Solution to the mainnet for BPs approval! ([Read in detail](https://steemit.com/eosio/@eosdac/the-lost-key-solution-updates)) This means that if it’s approved, **those who lost their Genesis private key since the mainnet launch can access their EOS funds!** [The first part: create eosio.lost account has been approved and executed today](https://eosauthority.com/approval/view?scope=eosdacserver&name=createlost&lnc=en). The next step is to install the code.

* **New custodian elected**: Myra from EOS Alliance onboards eosDAC as a Custodian! She had formerly worked with EOS Gravity and has been working as a [Deputy Executive Director of the EOS Alliance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180817005432/en/EOS-Alliance-Launches-Mandate-%E2%80%9CEmpower-EOS-All%E2%80%9D). We are excited about that more and more EOS enthusiast joining the eosDAC Custodian board. Welcome to eosDAC, Myra!
*(Current Custodian Board - they are re-elected every 7 days! If you want to engage in running eosDAC and make decisions for it, stake a minimum of 35000 EOSDAC and register yourself as a candidate on https://members.eosdac.io/)*

* Good news for all token holders **who had their tokens stuck on ETH based dex** like IDEX, Forkdelta, EtherDelta and others. We have started sending tokens via multisigs transactions signed by eosDAC custodians. To claim your tokens, please follow [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/j_mlzDNcTIM).
Transfer of tokens will be proposed as Msigs after verification and will require 10/12 custodian approval. 
[View current Multisigs](https://members.eosdac.io/custodian/review-msigs)

* Token contract and security: 8/10 of the top tokens on EOS have a single owner key which controls (single point of failure) whereas EOSDAC is controlled by 12 Custodians. One of many reasons why eosDAC chooses to be a DAC. Read our [latest post on the DAC's approach to token contract security]( https://steemit.com/eosio/@eosdac/improve-token-security-by-adopting-dacs-like-permissions).

* Furthermore, you can watch [Luke's short walk-through of the eosDAC member client](https://youtu.be/ORlMwVyHqxI) and grasp an overview of the DAC permissions which make all this, seemingly complicated but in real just simple and secure stuff work. 

* Watch [this week’s EOS Radio episode](https://youtu.be/et095r8jXZo) featuring Luke (eosDAC), Yves (EOS Nation) and Scott (Greymass) covering important topics such as EOS inflation, effects of burning WPS funds, how it relates to the overall structure of EOS

# Republic of Liberland to become the first government body to adapt DAC technology

Exciting news for all DAC supporters! We’ve got a DAG (Decentralized Autonomous **Government**) preparing to launch on EOSIO! 
* Michael did a presentation on DACs showcasing our Member Client at Liberland last week:

And following this presentation, Liberland has just announced the [DAG (Decentralized Autonomous **Government**) initiative with EOSIO](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2019/04/liberland-initiates-decentralized-autonomous-government-with-eosio). Dan’s reaction?

* Learn about Liberland with this video. From [24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7b6NIGEYNg&feature=youtu.be&t=1469), the president of Liberland talks about how DACs/DACs can be more transparent and efficient than the traditional systems, and how every company in Liberland will also have a DAO/DAC.
