Brock Pierce remains one of the few entrepreneurs to have etched their name across various disconnected industries, including acting, gaming, venture capital, and cryptocurrency. Pierce’s proxy has been supporting eosDAC as a technically competent BP. He also has explicitly shown his appreciation towards what eosDAC is doing for the EOS ecosystem in his interview with the eosDAC team:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ddfqWFUaTM

> *“One of the greatest BPs in the space, determined by technical competency and all the basic prerequisites being met. They are the key contributors to the community. 
...
I view block producers in this sort of liquid democratic system, as being stewards that are contributing to the community, often selflessly, and eosDAC embody that.
...
This team has been around since the beginning and contributing in major ways including launching the network, tirelessly contributing to the EOS ecosystem and they are trying to do it in the best way possible.”*

To express his interest in the eosDAC Community and our technical progress with the DAC Factory he recently did a [keynote presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dsg3zotv1UdFoSWpDC_3cuG9gCeQf7n9/view) at Tulip Conference where he showcased eosDAC member client . He views himself as **“a huge believer in DACs/DAOs”** and believes the future is DAOism. 

He registered himself as a Custodian candidate last Tuesday (June 4th), and has since been elected as a custodian by the eosDAC community -  eosDAC is honoured to have him onboard!

Members of eosDAC are thrilled to have such a successful and influential crypto pioneer with eosDAC in paving the new road for DACs and the future we will be forging together with globally distributed Custodians with unique backgrounds and perspectives. Diverse and active community is the key to success of the DAC and we invite all of the blockchain community, and decentralisation enthusiasts to join and participate in eosDAC today.


> *In the future we will create full alignment of interests, where it's going from that mentality to that abundance mentality, it's where we go from caring only about ourselves to caring about the collective community, and these are the things we're going to get as we build out these new forms of governance, where we've got liquid democracy, where we got immutable records, ultimately we are watching at a systemic upgrading the entire system and it's gonna come from this(DACs). So what eosDAC is doing in moving towards proof of concept where hundreds or thousands of DAOs and DACs will be created in the future, trying to solve the world's biggest challenges has me so excited. Because there are so many things that I am looking to do using this sort of stuff. We don't have the systems yet to be able to roll that out effectively... so thank you eosDAC for what you're doing on this front and doing it for the EOS Community.*
