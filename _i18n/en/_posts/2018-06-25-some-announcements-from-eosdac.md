Dear eosDAC Community, 

Firstly, the eosDAC launch team would like everyone to make sure they have their EOSDAC tokens on the EOS chain. **These tokens are currently frozen and will be unlocked at 15:00 UTC 26th June 2018** unless there are major errors found in the validation process.

You can read about the distribution in detail here: https://steemit.com/eosdac/@eosdac/the-eosdac-token-distribution-is-complete

If you had eosDAC in an Ethereum address with less than 1 EOS during the EOS genesis snapshot,  you can claim the account we created for you by generating the EOS private key from your Ethereum private key using the eoskey.io tool by EOS Cafe. In case you are having trouble generating the right fallback keys for your Ethereum account, use this form to raise a request to claim your eosDAC tokens - https://goo.gl/iK1scT
 
We received a lot of queries in the past 2 weeks relating to tokens stuck with DEX's like ForkDelta and IDEX. Although we did try to ensure everyone was aware of the need to get tokens off of exchanges we do appreciate it is unfortunate that some people got their tokens stuck in these exchanges while we were in the process of swapping eosDAC token over to the EOS mainnet.  We are trying to work on a solution to honour these tokens on EOS chain, although nothing can be promised at this time as to when and how this will work. More information on the process will be rolled out as we get closer to release it. 

Please fill out the google form below to send us your claim request. - https://goo.gl/WQW8NH

## FAQ's

> *When will I be able to transfer EOSDAC tokens to my exchange wallet?*

As soon as the EOSDAC tokens are unfrozen, exchanges will have to carry out their own checks and ensure they have the correct code in place to manage deposits and withdrawals.

> *What is the best wallet to store EOSDAC?*

As of now the best wallet that is ready for EOSDAC tokens is SimplEOS by EOS Rio. 
Github https://github.com/eosrio/simpleos/releases

> *I left my tokens in an unregistered wallet, do I lose my tokens?*

If in any case, your tokens are still in your unregistered ERC20 wallet, do not panic, we have got you covered. Most will have been covered by the fallback process and you may well already have an EOS account we made for you, We will have a further process in the near future to bring the tokens from any unregistered ERC20 wallets over to the EOS chain. More details will be provided as we get closer to release this process.
