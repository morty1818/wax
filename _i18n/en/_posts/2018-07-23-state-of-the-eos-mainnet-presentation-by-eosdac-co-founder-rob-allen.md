At [‘When EOS Rules The World'](https://www.meetup.com/London-Cryptocurrency-event/events/252500168) event in London hosted by [@SVK_Crypto](https://twitter.com/SVK_Crypto), a VC fund which recently received a major investment from Block.one, eosDAC co-founder Rob Allen was invited to present a block producer’s view of the 'State of the EOS Mainnet'. He spoke alongside other presenters such as Brendan Blumer (CEO of Block One), Serg Metelin (Head of Developer Relations at Block.One), David Packham (founder EOS 42), and others. 

Listen to Rob’s live podcast at the end of the event with other speakers, [listen to the podcast](http://podcast.svkcrypto.com/e/svk-crypto-podcast-184-17072018-live-from-svk-cryptos-eos-event/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter).

Rob talked about the EOS blockchain, current strengths and challenges, and outlook, from the perspective of a block producer:

* Status of EOS Mainnet
Governance issues including ECAF’s Arbitration Orders, Block.one’s second proposed constitution, airdrops, new tools such as wallets, explorers, account toolkits, and also concerns about high RAM costs and the impact on developers. 

* Challenges
The fact that many block producers are voted in by a small group of accounts with large holdings. If they act as a cartel, they could take full control of the chain.

* Opportunities
Hardware Wallets, other Chains, airdrops, Decentralised Autonomous Communities (DACs) are the future.

* About DACs
DACs can take out the centralised profit extractor and share profits with their communities.
Think Uber, AirBnB, LinkedIn et.al.
