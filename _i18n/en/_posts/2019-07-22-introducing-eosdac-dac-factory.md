eosDAC is delighted to announce our plan for the premium DAC hosting service: DAC Factory! You will be able to create a Decentralized Autonomous Community(DAC) to fit the needs of your organization and community with just a few simple steps, all hassle-free.

### Wait - Everything eosDAC develops is open-source. Why is this service premium? 

Yes. All the tools eosDAC has developed to create, launch and run our DAC are shared with the community: https://github.com/eosdac/eosdac-factory and https://github.com/eosdac. However, running a DAC requires some technical skills like state history node, running an API filler, API processor, and API itself - for these three different services you’d have to rent a server to run those yourself. On top of that, you’d also need to rent another server to host the member client itself. Even though there’s a [step-to-step guide](https://steemit.com/dac/@eosdac/tutorial-launching-your-own-dac-on-the-jungle-test-network-with-eosdac) provided by Luke, it can still be bewildering for people with limited technical backgrounds. The DAC Factory's got you covered. We will provide this service for people who don’t want the hassle of running an entire DAC backend server themselves, so they can turn the key and move onto building their project quicker. However, again, the core of what we do will always be open source and available for the community.

### So what is included in DAC Factory: Hosted DAC Solution?

The DAC Factory will have four main categories to customize:
**The basics** - to set up the name of your very own DAC, description, ID (account name of DAC) and symbol
**Tokenomics** - such as token issuance, maximum supply and decimal
**Branding & URL** - homepage URL, logo, and different colour scheme for your DAC!
**Custodian Configurations** - you can decide the number of custodians to run the DAC, custodian period length, percentage of tokens that need to vote before the DAC can launch, the required amount of tokens to register as a Custodian, maximum votes, different permissions settings, pay for custodians and other details crucial to run a DAC.



### Pricing and Community Feedback
There will be a monthly service fee for hosting your member client and contracts as well as keeping you up-to-date with the latest industry standards as we continue development of our own DAC. We are still discussing with the community on actual pricing and which currency the service user should pay in. We would love to hear YOUR input on these:

- Would you pay $100 a month for this service?
- Should the payment be using EOSDAC tokens?


Leave comments down below or jump into discussions with other members on [Discord.io/eosdac](https://discord.io/).



Our goals for this service are to: 
1. Enable ANYONE regardless of technical background to be able to launch and run their own DAC.
2. Create additional revenue for eosDAC to be able to fund further development of DACs.


Exact product details, such as pricing, payment methods will be provided upon launching the service, but please give us any feedback you think would be helpful. 

Thanks for your help and interest in DACs. Stay tuned for the followup updates!
