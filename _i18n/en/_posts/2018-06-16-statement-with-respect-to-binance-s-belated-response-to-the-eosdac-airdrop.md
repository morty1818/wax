Many people will have seen the notice from Binance https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004750832-Notice-of-Binance-Support-for-EOS-Airdrops-IQ-DAC-and-EON  . The eosDAC launch team is making the assumption that DAC means eosDAC.

The launch team have assessed this and view it as necessary to state the situation so that everyone can gain clarity.

Firstly, it has be to be understood that eosDAC did not want to airdrop to exchanges that were not planning to support the airdrop; Dropping tokens blindly to exchanges posed a risk of a significant percentage of tokens ending up in the wrong hands. Therefore, eosDAC spent considerable time assessing which accounts were exchanges and ensuring that the exchanges which did support the airdrop were given eosDAC. A criteria was published which explained that exchanges needed to make an effort to notify us of their intention to support the airdrop by 15th May 2018. We also contacted all of the major exchanges many times, with the help of our growing community. In some cases, there was a miscommunication and we were made aware of the support after this date, but there was evidence that the exchanges had tried to make contact.

In Binance's case, there were many requests but the consistent response received was:-

_**'Normally, Binance does not support coinfork and candy airdrop'**_ and _**'if there is any that we decide to support, an announcement will be issued at least 7 days in advance'.**_

Due to this it was stated by the launch team that their tokens would be burned. Hence their totals were not included in the published eosDAC genesis distribution file https://github.com/eosdac/conversion/blob/master/files/eosdac_genesis_master.csv 

This distribution is now set to go and it cannot be tampered with except in extreme erroneous cases which do not contradict the previous statements of the launch team. To make any changes at this stage will clearly undermine the integrity of the distribution and the community trust of the launch team.

The distribution will be deployed to the EOS Mainnet after tokens have been unstaked and suitable tests and checks have been run and everyone has a chance to validate. 

Once custodians are voted to run eosDAC (expected during July), they may wish to consider proposals to reach out to Binance for belated support of the airdrop or to seek listing. With full consensus and community support, eosDAC and Binance may eventually be possible to come up with a solution for this which acts in the interests of Binance EOS token holders as at Ethereum Block  5442134 (https://etherscan.io/block/5442134), Binance itself and the wider eosDAC community. However, this is not within the remit of the launch team to resolve.

This statement will be forwarded to the address provided by Binance.
