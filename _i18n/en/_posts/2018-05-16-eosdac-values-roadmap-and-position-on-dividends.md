EOS GO have been producing an excellent series of reports on the EOS Block Producer candidates. These include candidates information in a consistent format so that token holders can compare the candidates objectively.

Recently, EOS GO asked the candidates to share their values, roadmap and position on dividends. For eosDAC, we have had these available on our website since March, but would like to make sure this is published on Steem as requested.

**The eosDAC values (Core Principles) are shown below.**

These values will be included in the eosDAC constitution

## Position on Dividends

eosDAC plans to use EOS token rewards as follows:-

1. To support growth of the EOS blockchain infrastructure. eosDAC will invest heavily in continuously upgrading and improving it’s operational infrastructure to ensure it achieves maximum speed, reliability and redundancy.

2. To proactively support the wider EOS community of Decentralised Application (DAPP) developers and end­users through investing in it’s own DAPP development and through providing community grants.

3. Once sufficient funds have been allocated to operational costs, infrastructure growth, community development and contingency funds, eosDAC intends to distribute surplus EOS tokens as decided by eosDAC token holders. This may take many formats including dividends.

It must however be emphasised that dividends given to the DAC members will NOT be dependent on their votes. DAC members will be rewarded regardless of their votes since they are the owners of the DAC. It should also be noted that although there may be considerable overlap between the DAC members and EOS token holders, the two distributions are distinct by design. 

eosDAC is an evolving Decentralised Autonomous Community which aims to empower its members.
