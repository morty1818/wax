# This weeks highlights 

* [Brock Pierce ‚Äì a child actor turned video-game entrepreneur turned crypto titan joins eosDAC custodian board!](https://steemit.com/eosio/@eosdac/brock-pierce-a-child-actor-turned-video-game-entrepreneur-turned-crypto-titan-joins-eosdac-custodian-board) Pierce‚Äôs proxy has been supporting eosDAC as a technically competent BP. He also has explicitly shown his appreciation towards what eosDAC is doing for the EOS ecosystem in his interview with the eosDAC team. He views himself as ‚Äúa huge believer in DACs/DAOs‚Äù and believes the future is DAOism - eosDAC is honoured to have him onboard!

* Security First!! **Protect your EOS account** using EOS permission management
Hoa(@eosdacvietnam) of eosDAC has uploaded the series of tutorials to improve your security - just follow these step-to-step guides, they are simpler than you might have thought!

1) EOS Guide: [How to use Waits (TX Delay)](https://steemit.com/eos/@eosdacvietnam/eos-guide-how-to-use-waits-tx-delay)

2) EOS Guide: [Keep your EOS account SAFE using Multisig Structure](https://steemit.com/eos/@eosdacvietnam/eos-guide-keep-your-eos-account-safe-using-multisig-structure)

3) EOS Guide: [Create Custom EOS Permissions For Each DApp](https://steemit.com/eos/@eosdacvietnam/eos-guide-create-custom-eos-permissions-for-each-dapp) 

Here‚Äôs a video demonstrating how to use multisignature permissions on bloks.io by Luke Stokes(@lukestokes)

* Emanate has recently introduced the Emanate Music Co-operative and their plan for decentralised governance. eosDAC has been partnered with Emanate since 2018, and now that Emanate is close to launching, they have announced that **eosDAC members will get an EMT airdrop as an incentive to join and help kick start the Musical Co-op!** ([Read the announcement here](https://medium.com/emanate-live/emanate-music-co-operative-1399f9aa17b7)) This will be one of the very first DACs being launched using the DAC Factory eosDAC has developed and a successful story of eosDAC incubating a DAC in not only technology wide but also in its structure and governance. Emanate is now in need of finding a group of pilot ‚ÄòEmanate Reps‚Äô who will be the first  to earn rewards by contributing to the Emanate network, so if you are interested, [join Emanate community](https://discordapp.com/invite/yBvsCnb)  now!

* Rob Allen of eosDAC has presented a proposal for the BOS community to vote upon, which would assist the BOSCore ecosystem and accelerate the implementation of [BOSCore community](https://t.me/boscorecommunity ) projects.

* In May 2018, [Vermont‚Äôs governor signed a bill allowing for the creation of so-called ‚Äúblockchain-based limited liability companies‚Äù](https://www.coindesk.com/vermontdao-state-governor-signs-bill-clearing-way-blockchain-companies). A step forward from this, dOrg, a DAO on Ethereum, has recently that they have created [the First Limited Liability DAO](https://www.coindesk.com/dorg-founders-have-created-the-first-limited-liability-dao), a legal way to reference smart contracts as the legitimate source of authority for their company‚Äôs operations and governance. eosDAC is looking into this option as well - if you live in Vermont and would like to see if you can set up a registered LL DAC, please contact us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/)

* If you would like to delegate to a proxy instead, here‚Äôs the list of proxies which support eosDAC:


[Brock Pierce Proxy](https://brockpierce.io/brock-pierce-eos-proxy/)
[Freedom Proxy](https://freedomproxy.org/)
[Colin Talks Crypto](https://www.alohaeos.com/vote/proxy/colintcrypto)
[Luke‚Äôs Proxy](https://www.alohaeos.com/vote/proxy/lukeeosproxy)
[Token Pocket Proxy](https://www.alohaeos.com/vote/proxy/rexproxy.tp)

If you lease your tokens on [Chintai](chintai.io), you‚Äôll be supporting eosDAC via their proxy 
If you you choose the default proxy to use REX, both [Token Pocket proxy](https://www.tokenpocket.pro/) and [EOSREX proxy](https://www.alohaeos.com/vote/proxy/eosrex.io) include eosDAC!


# Approved Msigs of the Week
We have *7* msig proposals approved and executed since the last DAC Weekly Recap.

[Transfer EOSDAC For Tokens Stuck In ETH Based Dex IDEX/Etherdelta](https://bloks.io/transaction/B80F957C2B7B5C49BEE4569EB4034C436A7C51BD9FC331676C7598AD13A15505)
[Transfer EOSDAC For Tokens Stuck In ETH Based Dex IDEX/Etherdelta](https://bloks.io/transaction/53FC75CD8E02CA3483A2237F04D4AA0D5CBD58B2F6B6EF1ABB0B1CD32A690FE4)
[Transfer EOSDAC For Tokens Stuck In ETH Based Dex IDEX/Etherdelta](https://bloks.io/transaction/88B42E169C46B18D3B5F8A60EAF1BB8108632E9CF704DB1F126DAA6EF90942EA)

These are requests of eosDAC Erc 20 token holders who didnot withdraw their funds from DEXs before the token freeze hence their tokens got stuck in the DEXs. eosDAC has secured these tokens under `eosdactokens` contractand is now releasing them to verified token holders.
[Vietnamese Translation & Comms](https://bloks.io/transaction/2471ECB27030596C1C24059B88968CFAA06672E66A6997E31B82E7EA65CB3421)
[Chinese Translation](https://bloks.io/transaction/2199F923554C5EB19469EA917B47B69238DD811740FC883114B5C040600302B8)
[Russian Translation](https://bloks.io/transaction/5FA19E4947D1C19C145708B3ECD259AF540E097E85B007ECAC2848570A1A2FF3)

eosDAC currently supports English, Korean, Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese (the member client is available in more languages) and these are payment for the translators. 

[May : Community And Comms Payment](https://bloks.io/transaction/8F4DE66B15E8D43506FE26F24E1290671CC2280867CFA3B6CE71F446B21A93E5)

This was the second attempt as the original proposal which was approved last time failed to be executed due to the DAC account not having enough funds. This can happen, we are all in iteration phase to improve the user experience of the client! 
 
Transparency is the major advantage of being a DAC. You can check all of the submitted & executed worker proposals on https://members.eosdac.io/custodian/review-msigs
