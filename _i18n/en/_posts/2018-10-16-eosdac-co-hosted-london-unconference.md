Last month [EOS Global Hackathon](https://eoshackathon.io/) and [Blockchain live 2018](https://blockchainlive.com/) were held in London. eosDAC, together with @eosauthority and @eos42 - block producers with substantial UK teams - thought we serve the the global community gathering in London by creating the space for us to connect and discuss ideas and collaboration. @attic-lab, @eos.sw-eden, @eosamsterdam, @sheos and [DACOCO.IO](https://dacoco.io/) also graciously sponsored this initiative.

The event on 25th September was conducted in two sessions: Afternoon Hangout and Drinks Reception.

### Afternoon Hangout

All participants who are blockchain professionals and experts were asked to choose a couple of topics on-site, and have two rounds of group discussions and come up with a brief conclusion. They were divided into four big groups depending on the different areas of interest, and each group discussed topics relevant to the area of interest. This is the summary of all groups.


**Tech:**
Current state of EOS IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication), its use cases, the way it works, GDPR, and API Latency.

**Dapps and Future:**
Difficulties of the Current DAPPs on Mainet such as account costs, complicated account creation process for users, token locked up in exchanges, lack of key features such IBC, and funding mechanics.

**Governance:**
 ECAF and BP Blacklist actions, eosio.sudo/eosio.wrap ([the proposal](https://eosauthority.com/approval/view?scope=libertyblock&name=createwrap&lnc=en) is currently approved by eosDAC) - what it enables and what is good for, how it would add to transparency, Referendums - on-chain voting tool is being developed, providing some orderly environment promote voter engagement while avoiding centralisation, proxy vote. (To find out more about Referendum - please visit [here](https://eosvotes.io/)). As this group was the biggest group, they also covered Constitution/compliance, exchange transparency and solutions and working groups for the worker proposal system.

**Community:**
