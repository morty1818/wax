# EOS Report…

### EOSIO 1.8 Upgrade - Date Proposed: Sept 23, 2019. 
To all EOS BPs - The proposed date for the upgrade to v1.8 is Sept 23 @ 13:00 UTC. Please sign [this reference](https://eosauthority.com/polls_details?proposal=eosupgrade_20190709#status) to acknowledge the time. 

When the date is 100% set, every single node on the network has to upgrade before the date. Any node which doesn't upgrade will immediately be kicked off the network and will no longer receive blocks and no longer have any history. 

EOS Developers as well have to make sure to have their dApps upgraded to 1.8 as well as there will be changes to the history nodes. 

The main change in the 1.8v upgrade, which B1 needs for Voice, is the first payer. Up until now, if there are two authentications on a transaction, then they split the CPU/NET cost. However, in 1.8, the first listed authentication will pay, which means that Block.One will sign transactions on behalf of the user and also for Voice and then they pay for the CPU.
