* CryptoLions is creating a Multi Sig for **Simple Assets** on the Mainnet with eosDAC,  Aloha EOS,  EOS 42,  EOS Asia,  EOS Cafe Block, EOS New York, EOS Metal, Scatter and sw/EDEN. When deployed, the owners of digital assets created Simple Assets can be sure that no malicious changes will affect their assets. Learn about Simple Assets MultiSig [here](https://medium.com/@cryptolions/simple-assets-multisig-9eb267c1ff1)

* What’s all the fuss about multi-signature you might ask. We have been constantly voiced out how important it is to have multi-layered permissions and how adapting the DAC model and multi sig is a safer security solution. Recently some dApps got hacked due to using a single owner key. Hoa, a Memeber of eosDAC has published [EOS Guide: Keep your EOS account SAFE using Multisig Structure](https://steemit.com/eos/@eosdacvietnam/eos-guide-keep-your-eos-account-safe-using-multisig-structure) and we strongly recommend you to read and try it out. 

* Are you currently not voting for eosDAC (nor voting for a proxy which supports eosDAC?) Here is [why you should vote for eosDAC as a EOS BP](https://steemit.com/eosio/@eosdac/why-eosdac-deserves-eos-bp-support-updated)

If you would like to delegate your votes to a proxy instead, here’s the list of proxies which support eosDAC:

[Brock Pierce Proxy](https://brockpierce.io/brock-pierce-eos-proxy/)
[Freedom Proxy](https://freedomproxy.org/)
[Colin Talks Crypto](https://www.alohaeos.com/vote/proxy/colintcrypto)
[Luke’s Proxy](https://www.alohaeos.com/vote/proxy/lukeeosproxy)
[Token Pocket Proxy](https://www.alohaeos.com/vote/proxy/rexproxy.tp)

If you lease your tokens on [Chintai](chintai.io), you’ll be supporting eosDAC via their proxy 
If you you choose the default proxy to use REX, both [Token Pocket proxy](https://www.tokenpocket.pro/) and [EOSREX proxy](https://www.alohaeos.com/vote/proxy/eosrex.io) include eosDAC!

# EOS Report…

### [9,800,000 EOS tokens unstaked from b1 account!](https://bloks.io/transaction/9f1a66b40433f43b28cabe8992cf2c184174c9764eb324871c668ec933250864)

### EOSIO Labs™ Release: The EOSIO™ Explorer
Block.One has released EOSIO Explorer, a new web-based graphical user interface to improve the developer experience of interacting and monitoring EOSIO-based applications and networks in development.

It has two distinctive features: Inspect and Interact
Inspecting features allow developers to view connected blockchain information, individual block, transaction and action details, and accounts details with associated smart contracts, which is useful for verifying data transmitted between an application and the blockchain and verifying functionality of a smart contract.

On the other hand, Interacting features allow developers to edit, import and create development accounts — with relevant public and private key pairings, upload and deploy smart contracts and generated ABIs, and push actions coded in smart contracts. This is most useful for user testing and verifying accounts interacting with your application.
