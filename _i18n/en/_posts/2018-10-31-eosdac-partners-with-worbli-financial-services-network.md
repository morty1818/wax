## eosDAC's Code of Conduct
The primary objective of eosDAC is to ensure that it is able to continuously produce blocks required by EOS.IO software driven blockchains. We want EOS.IO blockchains to flourish so we will engage with EOS communities with a view of initiating and supporting projects that benefit all EOS.IO blockchain communities. This will include tools for other DACs.


## What is WORBLI?
>WORBLI is a financial services network (FSN) where enterprises and individuals can access a broad range of services. WORBLI's ecosystem leverages EOSIO software and is capable of hosting a variety of decentralized applications (dApps) focused on financial innovation, security, reliability, and compliance.


## Why Sister Chain?
>WORBLI is a financial services network, entities who interact with the blockchain, including block producers and individuals, must be AML/KYC verified in order to leverage all products and services and this is why this can't be built on EOS mainnet. (Users can still create a WORBLI account without completing KYC/AML verification, they'll just have limited access to some features.)

>Unlike many examples of chain forks in the past, WORBLI is in no way contentious with EOS mainnet, in fact, it is quite the opposite. The WORBLI team are working hard to enhance the EOS network through inter-blockchain communication (IBC) with the EOS mainnet and other blockchains. WORBLI will be educating the community about EOS and WORBLI, and supporting the network through a WORBLI Network Fund, proposals and incentives. Through applications on the WORBLI network such as Gamma (fiat/crypto bank currently in development), regulated payment gateways will be accessible for users using EOS and WORBLI, all facilitated by IBC.

>Sister chains and forks such as WORBLI have been envisioned by EOS creators as they are aware of the potential that independent blockchains can be created for specific use cases. The possibilities of different chains are vast and will greatly enhance the overall EOS ecosystem. WORBLI will become the financially focused arm of EOS, opening up a borderless ecosystem to billions of people around the world and large enterprises who are seeking superior frameworks to conduct themselves in.

## Block Producers of WORBLI
>WORBLI Block producers are selected based on a rigorous process by the WORBLI Foundation, instead of being voted in. BPs are contracted to provide services to the Worbli network and agree to maintain certain compliance standards. This allows auditing and diligence to be undertaken in order to remain compliant with financial regulations. WORBLI's network is required to have its own governance layer, hence the need for an insulated and independent chain by way of a code fork (sister chain / friendly fork).
