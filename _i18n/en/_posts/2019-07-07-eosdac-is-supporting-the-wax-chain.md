# eosDAC Vision
It is the vision of eosDAC that EOS.IO block production should be open for everyone to contribute and benefit. To realise this vision, eosDAC is an evolving Decentralised Autonomous Community (DAC) focused on EOS.IO Block Production serving the EOS communities worldwide. In doing this, eosDAC is creating the tools and smart contracts it needs to function. It will share these with the EOS communities to help other DACs thrive on the EOS.IO blockchains.


# eosDAC's Code of Conduct
The primary objective of eosDAC is to ensure that it is able to continuously produce blocks required by EOS.IO software driven blockchains. We want EOS.IO blockchains to flourish so we will engage with EOS communities with a view to initiating and supporting projects that benefit all EOS.IO blockchain communities. This will include tools for other DACs.

# WAX Token Swap and Staking & Voting Rewards
If you are an owner of ERC‑20 WAX Tokens, swap them for Genesis WAX Protocol Tokens now. The token swap period ends on August 30, 2019, at 5 pm Pacific Time and afterwards, the ERC-20 WAX Tokens will be burned and permanently decommissioned. Here is a step-to-step video tutorial: https://tokenswap.wax.io/

The WAX rewards the holders who stake their tokens and vote for Guilds, to increase community participation in the selection of guilds and blockchain improvement proposals. How to get the WAX Staking Rewards:


![Stake-Vote-StakingRewards.png](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmavnuTXyVQAw7DGETW3s1dpEVcPDgdt3cPstkCgsZtzqP/Stake-Vote-StakingRewards.png)

1. Stake your WAX Tokens. If your WAX Tokens are not staked, you will need to stake them using a Scatter wallet. If you have Genesis WAX Protocol Tokens, then they are already staked.

2. Vote via your Scatter wallet. If you have Genesis WAX Protocol Tokens in a WAX Blockchain account, you will need to connect a Scatter wallet to the account to vote. All WAX Token holders can vote for up to 30 WAX Guilds. The strength of your vote for any particular guild depends on the number of WAX Tokens you have staked.

3. Earn WAX Staking Rewards. WAX Token holders who stake their tokens and then vote with them will earn additional WAX Tokens. These earnings are called WAX Staking Rewards and are issued directly from the WAX Blockchain.
