At around 2am UTC time on Friday, June 22nd, the following messages were posted in the Keybase "top_eos_bps" channel which the top EOS block producers have been using to communicate securely with individuals using verified accounts representing their block producer group.

These messages were then posted to the <a href="t.me/EOSPros/40542">EOS BlockPros Telegram</a> channel:

The referenced forum posts can be seen here: [ECAF Notice to Parties to a Claim - Arb Order AO-02](https://forums.eosgo.io/discussion/1476/ecaf-notice-to-parties-to-a-claim-arb-order-ao-02) and [Proposal for Rules for Dispute Resolution](https://forums.eosgo.io/discussion/1010/proposal-for-rules-for-dispute-resolution)

Here is a screenshot of the PDF which was provided of the actual order:

Unfortunately, this pdf file isn't currently listed on the https://eoscorearbitration.io/ (ECAF) website for us to link to directly (though anyone can [view it](t.me/EOSPros/40542) via Telegram) nor is it on the blockchain, but we expect this to change in the future.

At this point, we at eosDAC, in accordance with the EOS Constitution ([Article IX - Dispute Resolution](https://github.com/EOS-Mainnet/governance/blob/master/eosio.system/eosio.system-clause-constitution-rc.md)), will comply with this emergency order and has updated the blacklist of our block producing node to prevent property loss. We recognize this as a **temporary** solution until the accounts mentioned in these claims are dealt with properly to recover what appears to be stolen accounts.

## For Discussion

The EOS Blockchain is a new experiment in on-chain governance. Historically, blockchains have been completely permission-less, immutable, and without any form of ethics. EOS takes the controversial approach to include a constitution as part of its DNA and create a mechanism where the intent of the code can be honored, not just the results. This, in theory, creates a pathway for protecting life, liberty, property, and justice without resorting to violence which has been the historical approach around the world for dealing with human conflict. For more on this, please see Dan Larimer's recent post [Decentralized Blockchain Governance](https://medium.com/@bytemaster/decentralized-blockchain-governance-743f0273bf5a).

In theory, this new approach EOS is taking will enable mass-adoption for those who are used to the protections existing governance systems provide. It's also unproven and unknown as far as the actual success it will have. Some who fear the unknown tend to jump to the worst possible conclusions as to the potential outcome. This arbitration order is an example of what's possible through this blockchain system, and it's an important moment in the early history of the EOS blockchain.

We, eosDAC, as block producers could, technically, ignore this order and face the consequences of the token holders voting for us as Block Producers to secure the EOS blockchain. Having not yet seen the evidence presented to ECAF, we could assume they are not acting in good faith and refuse to update the blacklist. The correct path forward for this would be for us to open our own arbitration case either via ECAF or some other trusted arbitration body. By doing so, its possible some would lose their EOS property. Currently, we have no reason or evidence to take this approach. On the other hand, we can review what has been presented above, in light of the intent of the EOS blockchain and constitution, and (for now) agree to comply in order to protect the property involved.

We've decided to agree to comply (for now).

If you are the owner of one of the accounts, we'd love to hear from you!

You are the ones directly impacted by this action. If you have been misrepresented or represented well, we want to know. We are open to additional arbitration groups looking into these cases and verifying the evidence if needed. We don't expect everything to work perfectly on the first try.

## Improvements We'd Like to See

1) Arbitration orders should be clearly published on the ECAF website and a blockchain or IPFS store for all to see. We hope to update this post and link to the order directly.

2) Verification of the authenticity of the order should involve a standard process such as an email notification, Telegram notification, Keybase notification, or text message to active BPs about the Zoom call where the order will be discussed and verified.

3) Whenever possible, a summary of the evidence should be provided to BPs so they can in turn share the same level of confidence ECAF has with the results.

We recognize the EOS blockchain and the systems of governance it uses are only days old and much is happening very quickly. We appreciate the hard work of many involved who believe in EOS and this important experiment for on-chain governance and non-violent dispute resolution. 

We understand how uncomfortable the idea of a blockchain with governance is for some people, and we encourage you to reach out to us and discuss your concerns. We are the community owned Block Producer which means we answer to you. Please, let us know what you think.

Many months of discussions have gone on in the [EOS Gov Telegram channel](https://t.me/EOSGov) and [EOS Governance, Economics, & Philosophy forum](https://forums.eosgo.io/categories/eos-governance-economics-philosophy) to get where we are today. Plenty more work is still to be done. You can also now view the [recorded Zoom chats between block producers here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvBCE-DChcYkEaXunwwov6g).
